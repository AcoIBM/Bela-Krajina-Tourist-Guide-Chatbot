This is a demo chatbot developed to show capabilities of the Watson Assistant (ex. Conversation) service. Its by no means perfect and complete, main purpose is to show how to create and use such a chatbot.

Folder Workspaces contains workspace exported from Watson Assistant. There are 4 workspaces:
a. Slovenian language version for Web UI
b. Slovenian language version for Facebook Messanger UI
c. English language version for Web UI
d. English language version for Facebook Messanger UI

The Web UI was created using a sample node.js app available at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-simple
This sample app was changed slightly as described in the file: How to create a Web UI.pdf

Big thanks to Sašo Marić and Anita Tomnič for co-developing this demo!
