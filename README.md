This is a demo chatbot developed with IBM Watson Assistant (ex. Conversation) service. It is by no means perfect and complete, the main purpose is to show how to create a chatbot using Watson.

The folder titled "Workspaces..." contains workspaces exported from Watson Assistant at IBM Cloud. Such workspace can be imported into Watson Assistant and used for further development. Four workspaces are included here:

a. A workspace in Slovenian language tailored for Web UI

b. Slovenian language for Facebook Messanger UI

c. English language for Web UI

d. English language for Facebook Messanger UI

The Web UI was created using a sample node.js app available at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-simple
This sample app was changed slightly as described in the file: How to create a Web UI.pdf

Big thanks to Sašo Marić and Anita Tomnič for co-developing this demo!
