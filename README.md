This is a demo chatbot developed to show capabilities of the Watson Assistant (ex. Conversation) service. Its by no means perfect and complete, main purpose is to show how to create and use such a chatbot.

The folder titled "Workspaces..." contains workspaces exported from Watson Assistant at IBM Cloud. There are 4 workspaces:

a. Workspace in Slovenian language tailored for Web UI

b. Slovenian language for Facebook Messanger UI

c. English language for Web UI

d. English language for Facebook Messanger UI

The Web UI was created using a sample node.js app available at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-simple
This sample app was changed slightly as described in the file: How to create a Web UI.pdf

Big thanks to Sašo Marić and Anita Tomnič for co-developing this demo!
